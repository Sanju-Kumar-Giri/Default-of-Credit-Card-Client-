# 📝 Description 
* This project analyzes the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict credit card default. The dataset includes various demographic factors, payment history, bill statements, and financial indicators of credit card holders. This project aims to gain insights into the factors that influence credit card default and develop accurate prediction models.

# ⏳ Dataset Overview
* The dataset provides a comprehensive view of credit card holders' profiles and their payment behavior. It contains information such as age, gender, education, marital status, payment history, and bill statements. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, we can identify patterns and correlations that may affect the likelihood of credit card default.
